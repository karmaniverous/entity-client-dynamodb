# CLI Plugin

These guides assume the DynamoDB plugin is mounted under the shipped `aws` plugin, so commands are invoked as `aws dynamodb ...` and configuration lives under `plugins["aws/dynamodb"]`.

- [Install & Host Integration](./install-and-host.md) - Add the plugin to a get-dotenv host and wire createCli/use().
- [Versioned Layout & Tokens](./versioned-layout.md) - Opinionated tables/NNN layout and file tokens with fallback EM resolution.
- [Table Lifecycle](./table-lifecycle.md) - generate, validate, create, delete, and purge flows with comment-preserving YAML.
- [Authoring Transforms](./authoring-transforms.md) - defineTransformMap handlers; drop/one/array semantics and limitations.
- [Data Migration](./migrate.md) - Step discovery, concurrency knobs, and progress ticks.
- [Config Overlays & Dotenv Expansion](./config-overlays.md) - plugins.dynamodb config, precedence, and $VAR expansion.
- [Local DynamoDB](./local-dynamodb.md) - Start/stop/status for Local; start waits until healthy.
- [Serverless Integration](./serverless.md) - Import generated YAML sections into Serverless Framework.
- [CLI Usage Recipes](./recipes.md) - Practical end-to-end command examples.
