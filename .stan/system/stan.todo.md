# Development plan

## Next up (priority order)

- Follow-up on legacy monolith:
  - Reconcile current .stan/system/stan.requirements.md (legacy, >300 LOC).
  - Propose decomposition into topical requirements docs (keep monolith read-only)
    and link from a lightweight index.

## Completed

**CRITICAL: Append-only list. Add new completed items at the end. Prune old completed entries from the top. Do not edit existing entries.**
- Docs: compact README + TypeDoc guides (core & CLI Plugin section with index)
  - Replaced long README with landing page and bulleted index.
  - Added targeted guides under docs/guides and docs/guides/cli with children front matter on CLI index.
  - Updated typedoc.json projectDocuments to include all guides.
